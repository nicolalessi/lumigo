🔍 Transparent Product Search Toolkit

A set of tools to analyze and rank product recommendations without ads or sponsored bias.

About This Project
The Alpha product has experimental modules for:
Review sentiment analysis (detecting fake/incentivized reviews)
Price tracking (identifying inflated "discounts")
Source reliability scoring (weighting blogs/forums like Reddit)

Why It Matters
Modern product search is broken:
72% of first-page Google results are ads (SparkToro, 2023)
42% of Amazon reviews are unreliable (Fakespot)

These tools help developers:
✔️ Scrape ethically (robots.txt compliant)✔️ Visualize ranking factors (transparency-first)✔️ Build alternatives to ad-driven platforms
Get InvolvedContribute: PRs welcome for new data sources or analysis models.
